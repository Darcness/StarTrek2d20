    "Environment.common.homeworld.name": "Homeworld",
    "Environment.common.homeworld.description": "The character comes from the world that birthed their civilization, and has been surrounded by cultural and spiritual legacies their entire life. Species homeworlds are often utopian and idyllic, serving as the platonic ideal of that species’ culture. They also exemplify aspects of a culture’s most revered traditions, and serve as the heart of that civilization’s legal and political landscape.",

    "Environment.common.busyColony.name": "Busy Colony",
    "Environment.common.busyColony.description": "The character comes from one of their culture’s oldest or most prosperous colonies, which may be another world within their home system — such as Luna or Mars for Humans — or one of the first worlds colonized after the culture achieved interstellar flight. These colonies often develop a fiercely independent outlook, often having developed with little direct aid from their homeworld, and a sense of pride that accompanies being amongst the first of their kind to tame another world.",

    "Environment.common.isolatedColony.name": "Isolated Colony",
    "Environment.common.isolatedColony.description": "The character comes from a colony that is isolated from broader galactic society. Worlds like the Vulcan monastery on P’Jem use the vast distances between star systems as an opportunity for contemplative isolation, while others are settled because they present unique research opportunities. The cultures of these colonies tend to focus on learning and introspection.",

    "Environment.common.frontierColony.name": "Frontier Colony",
    "Environment.common.frontierColony.description": "The character comes from a colony located on the fringes of known space, either on the edge of uncharted space or on the border with another civilization. Frontier colonists tend to be hardy and determined, even stubborn, and well-prepared for the dangers that their home may pose.",

    "Environment.common.starshipOrStarbase.name": "Starship or Starbase",
    "Environment.common.starshipOrStarbase.description": "The character grew up in space, travelling aboard a starship or living aboard a space station or starbase. While they’re unlikely to have lived aboard a Starfleet vessel — only some of them carry families — many freighters, transports, and other civilian vessels have a tradition of family or generational crews, and many officers with families take postings to starbases rather than ships. Those raised in space learn the ins-and-outs of shipboard life as children, and many are groomed for leadership, or learn to fly a shuttle in their formative years.",

    "Environment.common.anotherSpeciesWorld.name": "Another Species' World",
    "Environment.common.anotherSpeciesWorld.description": "The character grew up amongst another species. They might have lived amongst a small enclave of their own kind, or they may have been orphaned by some manner of disaster and raised by aliens. Whatever the situation, the character has unique perspectives on their own species and on those they were raised alongside.",

    "Environment.klingon.homeworld.name": "Qo'noS",
    "Environment.klingon.homeworld.description": "You hail from the Klingon homeworld of Qo’noS, often called Kronos by outsiders, and you’ve been surrounded by the cultural and spiritual legacies of Kahless and the Empire for your entire life. The oldest and most revered of Klingon traditions came from your homeworld, and they are a defining part of your upbringing.",

    "Environment.klingon.busyColony.name": "Busy Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.busyColony.description": "You come from one of the Empire’s oldest or most prosperous colonies. These colonies often have a fiercely independent outlook, having developed with little aid from the Empire in their earliest days, and the pride that accompanies being amongst the first of their kind to tame an alien world still remains in the descendants of those first settlers.",

    "Environment.klingon.isolatedColony.name": "Isolated Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.isolatedColony.description": "You come from a colony isolated from the rest of the Empire, and from the wider Galaxy. Worlds like Boreth use this isolation as an opportunity for spirituality and contemplation, while others are settled because they present unique opportunities to perform research far from the scrutiny and politicking of the core worlds. Even in the Empire, these worlds emphasize learning and introspection.",

    "Environment.klingon.frontierColony.name": "Frontier Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.frontierColony.description": "You come from a colony located on the fringes of the Empire, either on the edge of explored space or on the border with the Federation or the Romulan Empire. Your world may even have been claimed from one of those rival powers during a conflict in previous generations. Frontier colonies tend to produce determined people, stubborn and well-prepared for the dangers their home may present, and entirely willing to fight to keep what they have settled.",

    "Environment.klingon.starshipOrStarbase.name": "Starship or Starbase",
    "Environment.klingon.starshipOrStarbase.description": "You grew up in space, travelling aboard a starship or living aboard a space station. You won’t have been raised aboard a warship, but many freighters, transports, and other civilian vessels have a tradition of family or generational crews. Those raised in space learn the ways of shipboard life as children, and many take to a spacefaring life easily as a result.",

    "Environment.klingon.anotherSpeciesWorld.name": "Another Species' World",
    "Environment.klingon.anotherSpeciesWorld.description": "You grew up amongst non-Klingons. Perhaps you were part of a Klingon enclave overseeing a conquered world, or you were raised amongst exiles, or orphaned during a battle or disaster and raised by aliens. You might have been raised in the Empire, or you may be an outsider to it. Whatever the situation, you have chosen to serve the Empire and prove that you are as Klingon as anyone born on Qo’noS, even if you may have different perspectives on Klingon culture and tradition.",

    "Environment.alternate.utopianParadise.name": "Utopian Paradise",
    "Environment.alternate.utopianParadise.description": "You were raised in an environment of peace, prosperity, and abundance. There was no war on your world, nor any poverty, homelessness, hunger, or crime. You knew of those things only from studies of history and you have never really been able to understand how a society could produce such destructive inequality. You have always had access to the resources to not merely survive, but to thrive in whatever endeavors you chose to pursue.",

    "Environment.alternate.cosmopolitan.name": "Cosmopolitan",
    "Environment.alternate.cosmopolitan.description": "You were raised in environments of trade or diplomacy, and the intermingling of different communities and cultures. The unfamiliar has always been familiar to you, and you had become familiar with dozens of cultures from distant worlds long before you were an adult. The frenetic pace of life and the basic need to revel in differences between groups and individuals have stayed with you as simple facts of existence in this big Galaxy.",

    "Environment.alternate.rigorousDiscipline.name": "Rigorous Discipline",
    "Environment.alternate.rigorousDiscipline.description": "You have always been surrounded by notions of duty and purpose, and your childhood was a strict one, aimed at preparing you to take on a specific role or to achieve a specific goal. This meant relatively little personal freedom, but it instilled within you a powerful sense of what you were capable of when pushed to succeed.",

    "Environment.alternate.ascetismAndIntrospection.name": "Ascetism and Introspection",
    "Environment.alternate.ascetismAndIntrospection.description": "Your life was a simple one, lacking in many of the luxuries that prosperous worlds take for granted. This was not because of a lack, but rather a choice – a belief amongst those you grew up with that external and material abundance can distract from self-knowledge and personal growth.",

    "Environment.alternate.struggleAndHardship.name": "Struggle and Hardship",
    "Environment.alternate.struggleAndHardship.description": "For one reason or another, your world was one with few available resources. Worlds on the frontier, as well as isolated outposts, are often places of hardship where continued survival is difficult, while other worlds struggle in the wake of natural or ecological disasters, the aftermath of war, or societal collapse that leaves basic infrastructure in ruins. Some seek out worlds such as this, where “honest toil” is held as a virtue, while others find themselves in lives of daily struggle through no choice of their own and seek to either better their world or escape it.",

    "Environment.alternate.occupationOrWar.name": "Occupation or War",
    "Environment.alternate.occupationOrWar.description": "Though the Federation’s members no longer war amongst themselves, warfare is still a part of the Galaxy. Local or planetary conflicts afflict many independent worlds, and interstellar conflicts ranging from border skirmishes to sector-spanning wars are something which all civilizations must prepare to face. Worlds ravaged by war, or even occupied by a hostile nation, are difficult places to live, often forcing people to adapt to horrific conditions and life-or-death decisions.",

    "Species.andorian.soloDescription": "An aggressive, passionate people from a frozen moon. Founding member of the Federation. Blue-skinned, pale-haired in appearance, with antennae. Their antennae aid in balance and spatial awareness; a lost antenna can be debilitating until it regrows.

Their antennae aid in balance and spatial awareness; a lost antenna can be debilitating until it regrows. Andorians also have a high metabolism, meaning, amongst other things, that they tire more quickly than Humans; this also makes them more vulnerable to infection from certain types of injury. Before the Federation, Andorians and Vulcans had numerous disputes; though these issues are largely considered to be ancient history, Andorians and Vulcans don’t always get along.",

    "Species.arbazan.name": "Arbazan",
    "Species.arbazan.soloDescription": "Like many Humanoid species within the Federation, the Arbazan are physically similar to Humans, though the forward portion of their skulls have slightly raised plates that reinforce their brows.

Examples: Reil Yesa (female), Latara Gel (male)",
    "Species.bajoran.description": "A spiritual, dauntless people from the planet Bajor, the Bajorans have lost much after decades of occupation by the Cardassian Union. Many Bajorans were scattered across the Alpha Quadrant during the occupation, while those who remained on Bajor often acted as insurgents or toiled in labor camps under Cardassian rule. The occupation ended a few years ago, but the scars it left will take generations to heal. Bajor is not a member of the Federation, but many Bajorans scattered by the diaspora have found their way into Starfleet. Bajoran culture places a strong belief in the Prophets, celestial beings who are said to have watched over Bajor for millennia; modern religious doctrine states that the Bajoran Wormhole is the Prophets’ Celestial Temple.",
    "Species.bajoran.exampleValue": "Faith in the Prophets",

    "Species.bajoran.traitDescription": "For obvious reasons, Bajorans tend to be hostile towards Cardassians, and resentful of those who are dismissive of, or turned a blind eye to, the suffering of the Bajoran people. While not all Bajorans are spiritual or religious to the same degree, most have a cultural understanding of the Prophets’ place in Bajoran society.",

    "Species.betazoid.name": "Betazoid",
    "Species.betazoid.aboutNames": "Betazoid names tend to have at least two syllables and a melodic sound, with a personal name followed by a family name; of these, the family name tends to have a harder sound. Betazoids are traditionally matriarchal, with children taking their mother’s family name.",
    "Species.betazoid.description": "The peaceful Betazoid people hail from the idyllic, verdant world Betazed. The world is a valued member of the Federation, and its people can be found across Federation space, including Starfleet. Betazoids appear almost identical to Humans, but differ in one major way: they are naturally telepathic, developing mental abilities during adolescence. The potency of this ability varies between individuals, but it has resulted in a culture where honesty and directness are fundamental: it is difficult to keep secrets when everyone around you can read minds.",
    "Species.betazoid.exampleValue": "Compassion Through Understanding",
    "Species.betazoid.soloDescription": "Betazoids appear almost identical to Humans, but differ in one major way: they are naturally telepathic, developing mental abilities during adolescence. All Betazoids are telepathic to varying degrees, and even when not actively using their abilities, they are highly perceptive of others around them, but also sensitive to telepathic disturbances and mental assaults. They have little familiarity with lies and deception, due to their open culture and ability to read the thoughts and emotions of others. As they are sensitive to the minds of other living beings, they tend not to be comfortable around animals, for fear of losing themselves in the minds of wild creatures.",

    "Species.bynar.description": "Over time their interconnection with their world’s master computer has grown to the point that their language and thought patterns have become as close to binary as is possible for organic beings.

    "Species.changeling.soloDescription": "A Changeling is naturally a gelatinous, morphogenic, orange-brown fluid, which can adopt the form and structure of any solid object, including other living creatures and diffuse substances like fog. While they cannot become energy, a Changeling’s ability to assume other forms is limited more by skill and experience than by physical capacity: it is theorized that they transfer mass to and from subspace to change size and density. Many Changelings find themselves persecuted by “solids” for their shapeshifting ability, and often crave a sense of order and justice in the universe, with a rigid attitude at odds with their fluid forms.",

    "Species.deltan.name": "Deltan",
    "Species.deltan.soloDescription": "Deltans are beautiful individuals, with powerful empathic abilities and heightened sensuality.

    "Species.denobulan.name": "Denobulan",
    "Species.denobulan.aboutNames": "Denobulans tend to only have a single name — an individual Denobulan may be part of several overlapping families. Some Denobulans may use the name of one of their spouses as an impromptu surname, however; this is often to indicate association to species that may not understand Denobulan families. Denobulan names tend to be short and hard-sounding, particularly male names.",
    "Species.denobulan.description": "Hailing from the planet Denobula, Denobulans are a gregarious, inquisitive people who have been allies of Humanity since the 2130s. Though Denobula was not one of the founders of the Federation, the Denobulans joined soon after. Denobulans are a sociable people, with distinctive expressive features, who are used to living in close, communal conditions, and whose extended family groups are large and complex — a Denobulan may have several spouses, each of whom may have several partners of their own, and dozens of children between them. Culturally, they are intellectually curious, perceptive, and interested in a wide range of philosophies, though their scholarly nature, large families, and gregarious nature means that relatively few of them venture far from their homeworld.",
    "Species.denobulan.exampleValue": "Safety in Numbers",

    "Species.denobulan.traitDescription": "Denobulans have a robust immune system, but a vulnerability to various forms of radiation poisoning. They are naturally adept climbers, scuttling up sheer walls like some forms of terrestrial lizard.

    "Species.doopler.description": "A humanoid species known for involuntarily duplicating themselves (dooplercating) as a defense mechanism against uncomfortable emotions such as embarrassment.

    "Species.gorn.name": "Gorn",
    "Species.gorn.soloDescription": "Gorn are large and powerfully-built, even more so than other famously-mighty species such as the Klingons or Nausicaans. They are many times stronger than a Human being, and resilient enough to ignore massive blunt force trauma or even short periods in hard vacuum. However, Gorn are not especially agile or fast. Gorn are ectothermic – cold- blooded – with their body temperature varying by external factors, and thus favor warm environments where they can be most active and effective.",

    "Species.hologram.name": "Hologram",
    "Species.hologram.soloDescription": "Holograms can be programmed to any specification, though the nature of their holomatrix means that they are essentially impervious to direct physical harm – they can allow energy and objects to pass through them at will. However, they are unable to go anywhere that lacks holographic emitters that can project their image and forcefields, and those emitters can be damaged even if the holograms themselves cannot. Holograms also tend not to receive much respect or consideration from flesh- and-blood people, who may see them as tools at best or annoyances at worst. While the majority of holograms are no more sentient than a character in a holo-novel, under the right circumstances, they can become self-aware and deserve the same rights as any biological sentient life-form. Holograms may also have a second species trait, reflecting the species they were designed to emulate.",

    "Species.human.name": "Human",
    "Species.human.aboutNames": "Human names vary wildly, and rather than make sweeping generalizations here, it’s better that Players seek out other sources for names, considering the vast range of languages, cultures, and traditions Humanity encompasses.",
    "Species.human.description": "Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a resilient, diverse, and adaptable species, who developed from fractious, warring nations on the brink of mutual annihilation to a united, peaceful society in less than a century, and managed to forge alliances between former enemies within a century of achieving interstellar space flight. Earth is a founder and pivotal member of the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.",
    "Species.human.exampleValue": "The Drive for Exploration",
    "Species.human.traitDescription": "Humans are adaptable and resilient, and their resolve and ambition often allow them to resist great hardship and triumph despite great adversity. However, Humans can also be reckless and stubborn, irrational, and unpredictable.",

    "Species.tellarite.name": "Tellarite",
    "Species.tellarite.aboutNames": "Tellarite names have considerable variation, but all tend to be composed of harsh, even guttural sounds. Tellarite names consist of a personal name and a family name, though the family name is often a compound, indicating that the family name is a patronym or matronym (the name of a father or mother, respectively), toponym(derived from a place) or similar — in this way, these prefixes are similar to “O’”, “Mc“, “von”, and similar elements in some Human names. Examples: Pola jav Brin (female), Tuk glasch Khutohk (male)",
    "Species.tellarite.description": "The stout, hirsute Tellarite species comes from Tellar Prime, a temperate planet in the Alpha Quadrant. Theirs is a culture noted for being abrasive and argumentative, with a stubborn pride, quick tempers, and little patience. However, this is only a superficial view: while Tellarites are argumentative, it comes from a sense of intellectual honesty and rigorous skepticism. To a Tellarite, no idea, concept, or person is beyond challenge or analysis, and any notion that cannot stand up to scrutiny is an unworthy one. Tellarites revel in debates, and tend to greet one another with criticisms, complaints, and even insults; failing to respond in kind is poorly- regarded, as it displays a weakness of character and an unwillingness to confront flaws.",
    "Species.tellarite.exampleValue": "All Ideas must Withstand Scrutiny",
    "Species.tellarite.traitDescription": "Tellarites have a keen sense of smell and a high tolerance for many common drugs, toxins, and inebriants (Tellarites don’t get drunk, just feisty).

    "Species.trill.aboutNames": "Trill names consist of a personal name and a family name, though in the case of a joined Trill, the family name is replaced with the name of the symbiont. Examples: Koria Inazin (female, unjoined), Bejal Okir (male, joined)",
    "Species.trill.description": "The Trill species, from their homeworld of the same name, appear almost identical to Humans, but for rows of spots running down the sides of their bodies, from head to toe. However, this superficial similarity conceals a considerable difference — the Trill are capable of bonding with a symbiotic organism known as a symbiont, creating a distinct being from the two individual creatures. The symbionts can live for many centuries, and are placed with successive hosts, carrying the memories and knowledge of previous hosts into a new joining with each new generation. This fact isn’t widely known outside the Trill themselves, but it isn’t a secret — it simply isn’t widely discussed, and the number of joined Trill is relatively small. The Trill have been part of the Federation for well over a century, with several renowned Trill serving important roles in shaping the Federation. The Trill, as a culture, tend to be focused on intellectual pursuits first and foremost, as learning and wisdom are prized by the symbionts in their hosts.",
    "Species.trill.exampleValue": "Four Lifetimes of Adventure",
    "Species.trill.traitDescription": "Trill are especially resilient to parasites, as a quirk of their potential to be Joined; Joined Trill are entirely immune to parasitic infection. However, they tend to have strong allergic reactions to insect bites and other forms of venom, which can disrupt their neurochemistry, particularly if they’re Joined. As many of the specifics of Trill physiology — especially with regards to symbiosis — are not widely known, this can result in medical complications.",

    "Species.vulcan.name": "Vulcan",
    "Species.vulcan.aboutNames": "Vulcans have only a single name, in practical terms — while they do have family names, these are not discussed amongst other species — and tend to be traditional in the names they use. Male Vulcans often — though far from always — are given names beginning with S, while female names frequently begin with T. These are far from universal, however.",
    "Species.vulcan.description": "The Vulcans are a stoic, rational people. Widely claimed to be emotionless, in truth the Vulcans feel deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Their stoicism comes from a culture of logic and self- discipline, where emotions are analyzed and dissected to rob them of their potency, so that they cannot overwhelm or control the individual. Vulcans embrace science and reason, but their lives are not purely devoted to logic: they also have a deeply philosophical side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic. They are also an intensely private people, with many aspects of their culture — such as the rites of pon farr — which are not discussed amongst outsiders.",
    "Species.vulcan.exampleValue": "The Needs of the Many Outweighs the Needs of the Few, or the One",
    "Species.vulcan.traitDescription": "Due to the harsh, arid, high-gravity world they come from, Vulcans are naturally resistant to extreme heat and dehydration; they are also extremely strong, with keen auditory and olfactory senses. They are also telepathic, though this takes training to properly manifest, and they learn mental discipline and emotional control from childhood. However, this control takes regular meditation to maintain, and their controlled nature and desire for privacy can distance them from others, and make interactions awkward.",
